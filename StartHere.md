# Introduction #

Writing for OS/X or the iPhone? Using _NSDictionary_ to store and access key-value pairs? Ever tried to enumerate them all only to find they come back in some random order? As _NSDictionary_ uses a hash table to map keys to values, it maintains no sort order whatsoever across its entries.
The _SortedDictionary_ class and its mutable companion, _MutableSortedDictionary_ implement dictionaries that maintain a strong sort order across their keys. _SortedDictionary_ and _MutableSortedDictionary_ deliver high performance using an implementation of a self-balancing binary tree.

# Capabilities #

The _SortedDictionary_ and _MutableSortedDictionary_ classes implement the interfaces of _NSDictionary_ and _NSMutableDictionary_, respectively, and can serve as drop-in replacements. They support the _NSCoding_, _NSCopying_ and _NSMutableCopying_ protocols.
Additionally, the sorted dictionary classes add methods allowing you to enumerate entries in both their forward and reverse key order, without having to sort and without any additional computational cost.

# How to use SortedDictionary in your code #

## Option 1: Using the source code ##

Add the _SortedDictionary_ folder to your project. Add all the files in the _SortedDictionary_ folder, including its _Internal_ and _External_ folders, into your project. When you build your project, the sorted dictionaries classes will be compiled into your application.
To create a sorted dictionary in code, include the appropriate header file:
```
 #import "SortedDictionary.h"
 
 - (void) someMethod {
    SortedDictionary *dict = [MutableSortedDictionary dictionary];
 
    [dict setValue: @"red" forKey: @"apple"];
    [dict setValue: @"yellow" forKey: @"banana"];
    [dict setValue: @"orange" forKey: @"orange"];
 
    NSString *color = [dict objectForKey: @"apple"];
 }
```
## Option 2: Using the compiled frameworks ##

Add the compiled frameworks to your project:
  1. In XCode, open Targets, then right-click (or ctrl-click) your target, and select Add>Existing Frameworks...
  1. The Target Info window opens. Click the + button below the Linked Libraries list. Select Add Other...
  1. Navigate to the folder that contains the compiled framework, and select SortedDictionary.Framework.
  1. Click Add, and close the Target Info window.
